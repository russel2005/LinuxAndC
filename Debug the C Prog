$ gcc -g -o fact fact.c
# -g option will collect the information from debugger
# -o will create a output file
# fact is the output file
# fact.c is the program file

#open in debugging mode by 'gdb' command
$ gdb fact   
(gdb) run
(gdb) where
#go by stack and find the problem with up/down
ex:
(gdb)up
(gdb)up
(gdb)down

#print the source code in debugger
(gdb) list

#find the line which make an error/ go to exact stack with up or down
(gdb)up
(gdb) print i    
(gdb) print day[i]
note: this is how we find the problem, first better to find the problem in the program by line number.
# quit from debugging mode Enter from keyboard> q or quit
(gdb) q
